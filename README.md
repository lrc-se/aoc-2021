Advent of Code 2021
===================

Solutions for the 2021 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/),
which this year are part of [Cygni](https://cygni.se/)'s [managed variant](https://cygni.github.io/aoc/) (Swedish only),
resulting in both certain restrictions and certain opportunities. We'll see how it goes.

JavaScript solutions will use [Deno](https://deno.land) this time around, for which a couple of shell scripts are included for convenience.
